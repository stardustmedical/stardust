Software Architecture for CNV Analysis Interpretation App
Introduction
This document outlines the software architecture for developing a Python-based application that interprets CNV (Copy Number Variation) profile analysis results from images. The app processes an input image of a CNV plot and outputs detailed genomic alterations along with a predicted tumor type.
---
Architecture Overview
The application is divided into several key components:
User Interface (UI)
Allows users to upload or capture CNV analysis images.
Image Processing Module
Preprocesses images to enhance quality for data extraction.
Data Extraction Module
Extracts numerical CNV data from processed images.
Data Interpretation Module
Analyzes extracted data to identify chromosomal alterations.
Tumor Prediction Module
Predicts tumor type based on interpreted CNV data.
Result Presentation Module
Displays the results to the user in an intuitive format.
Utilities and Helpers
Additional functionalities such as logging, configuration, and error handling.
Testing Suite
Unit tests for each module using pytest.
